## Lab 2 objectives:

- Project management (more subfolder structure & `here`)
- Continue meeting R Markdown
- More data wrangling (filtering, `mutate()`, and summary tables with `group_by` + `summarize`)
- Customization in `ggplot2`

## Packages required: 

- `tidyverse`
- `janitor`
- `here`
- `palmerpenguins`

### 1. Lab set-up & project management: 

- Create a new R Project (within your ESM 206 labs folder)
- Add subfolders `data`, `img`, `src`
- Copy and paste the `ca_ag_2014.csv` file into the project `data` folder
- In RStudio, create a new RMarkdown doc (.Rmd). Save to the `src` folder
- In your new R Markdown document, attach the `tidyverse`, `janitor`, `here`, and `palmerpenguins` packages in the setup chunk

## 2. A couple more R Markdown tips 

1. URL

    - Add a functional URL by just copying & pasting it: https://www.ucsb.edu/

    - Or add linked text [like this](https://www.ucsb.edu/).

2. Superscripts / subscripts

    - Superscript text with a ^ on either side: like^this^

    - Subscript text with a ~ on either side: like~this~

3. Add image from a URL

    - Find an image online (for more octocats - the GitHub mascot- visit https://octodex.github.com/)

    - Right click > Copy image location

    - Paste the image location into the parentheses in this format: `![](paste_image_location_here.png)`

For example: 

![](https://octodex.github.com/images/dinotocat.png)

But ask yourself: how does that break? What might be a safer and more robust way to include an image? 

## 3. Read in the data 

Today we'll use information from California crop production from 2014. 

First, open the CSV in Excel or other spreadsheet software (outside of R, open the file & it will open in Excel if you have it). Make sure to take a look at the data after you read them in. **Note:** Your file path will differ from the one below.

```{r}
# Read in the ca_agriculture.csv file
ca_ag <- read_csv(here("esm206-f2021-lab2", "ca_ag_2014.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()
```

## 4. More `dplyr::filter()` examples

a. Keep data from counties "Kern" OR "Inyo" OR "Mono"

Use `%in%` to look for multiple acceptable matches. 

```{r}
ex_a <- ca_ag %>% 
  filter(county %in% c("Kern", "Inyo", "Mono"))
```

b. Keep data for all counties EXCEPT Merced

Use `!=` to say "DOES NOT MATCH":

```{r}
ex_b <- ca_ag %>% 
  filter(county != "Merced")
```

**Tip:** Use the `unique()` function to check with distinct groups remain in a variable

c. Keep observations where crop is "GOATS MILK" and county is "Humboldt"

```{r}
ex_c <- ca_ag %>% 
  filter(crop_name == "GOATS MILK", county == "Humboldt")
```

d. Keep observations where crop is "GRAPES WINE" **or** harvest acres is greater than 1,000,000:

```{r}
ex_d <- ca_ag %>% 
  filter(crop_name == "GRAPES WINE" | harvest_acres > 1e6)
```

## 5. `mutate()` to add a new column (or transform an existing one)

We'll use the `mutate()` function in dplyr (part of the tidyverse) to add a new column, or to transform an existing one. 

In `ca_ag`, we have a column for "production" and one for "price per unit". We want a new column containing the value for each observation:

```{r}
ca_ag_value <- ca_ag %>% 
  mutate(value_usd = production * price_per_unit)
```

We can also use `mutate()` to transform existing columns. 

```{r}
ca_ag_lower <- ca_ag %>% 
  mutate(crop_name = str_to_lower(crop_name))
```


## 6. `group_by()` + `summarize()` for tables of summary statistics

We often want to find summary statistics (e.g. mean, standard deviation, max, min, etc.) within *groups* for our data. For example, we may want to find the total *value* of crops by *county* for California in 2014. But it would be really tedious to make a different subset for each county, then find those statistics. 

Instead, we will use the powerful combination of `dplyr::group_by()` and `summarize()` to:

- Recognize distinct groups within a variable
- Apply a function to each *group*
- Return the outcomes in a nice table

It is awesome. You should plan on using this all the time (if you're an Excel wizard, this is your replacement for pivot tables).

Here's a little example first using the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/). View the `penguins` data (`View(penguins)`). 

```{r}
penguin_bill_lengths <- penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(mean_bill_length_mm = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))

penguin_size_summary <- penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(mean_flipper_length_mm = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_body_mass_g = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE),
            sample_size = n())

penguin_size_summary
```

Now let's try one for our CA ag data, as part of a piped sequence! 

a. Create a summary table of the total sum of *value* by *county* for "GRAPES WINE". 

```{r}
ca_grapes <- ca_ag %>% 
  filter(crop_name == "GRAPES WINE", county != "State Total") %>% 
  mutate(value = production * price_per_unit) %>% 
  group_by(county) %>% 
  summarize(
    total_value_usd = sum(value)
  ) %>% 
  slice_max(total_value_usd, n = 10)

ca_grapes # return the table in knitted doc
```

## 7. Customizing ggplot graphs

```{r}
cc_ag <- ca_ag %>% 
  filter(county %in% c("San Luis Obispo", "Santa Barbara", "Ventura"))
ggplot(data = cc_ag, aes(x = county, y = production)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, 
              alpha = 0.8,
              size = 2,
              aes(color = county),
              show.legend = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("purple",
                                "darkorange",
                                "cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "California county",
       y = "Agricultural production (acres per farm)", 
       title = "California agriculture (2014)")
```
